# Hosting WordPress on AWS

This reference architecture provides a set of YAML templates for deploying WordPress on AWS using [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html), [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html), [Auto Scaling](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/WhatIsAutoScaling.html), [Elastic Load Balancing (Application Load Balancer)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html), [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html), [Amazon ElastiCache](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/WhatIs.html), [Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html), [Amazon CloudFront](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html), [Amazon Route 53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html), [Amazon Certificate Manager (Amazon ACM)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html)  with [AWS CloudFormation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html).

You can launch this CloudFormation stack, using your account, in the following AWS Regions:

| AWS Region Code | Name | Launch |
| --- | --- | --- 
| us-east-1 |US East (N. Virginia)| [![cloudformation-launch-stack](images/cloudformation-launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=WordPress&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-us-east-1/reference-architecture/wordpress/latest/templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-master.yaml) |

## Overview

![architecture-overview](images/aws-refarch-wordpress-v2017032901.jpg)

The repository consists of a set of nested templates which are run in order from the master template. Run the master template to create the entire stack, entering the appropriate parameters. Nested templates can be run individually in order, entering the appropriate input parameters for each stack.


## Steps to Run
To launch the entire stack and deploy a WordPress site on AWS, click on one of the ***Launch Stack*** links above or download the Master template and launch it locally.

#### Optional: Amazon Certificate Manager SSL/TLS Certificates

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services. SSL/TLS certificates provisioned through AWS Certificate Manager are free.

If you don't already have an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain name, it is recommended that you request one using ACM. For more information about requesting an SSL/TLS certificate using ACM, please read the [AWS Certificate Manager User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html).

Use ACM to request a certificate or import a certificate into ACM. To use an ACM certificate with CloudFront (optional input parameter), you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. To use an ACM certificate with Amazon ELB - Application Load Balancer (optional input parameter), you must request or import the certificate in the region you create the CloudFormation stack. After you validate ownership of the domain names in your certificate, ACM provisions the certificate. Use the ACM certificate Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as the optional Cloudfront and/or Public ALB ACM certificate input parameters of the master template.

#### Stack Creation

There are two output URLs for the master template. The WPSiteURL will take you to your new WordPress site. It will be the site domain name if you provided one, the CloudFront URL if you chose to create a CloudFront distribution, or the domain name of the public application load balancer.  The second output URL will take you to the OpCache Status page for each EC2 instance in the AutoScaling group. By refreshing the page you will be able to verify OpCache has been enabled on each instance.

#### OpCache

OpCache is a byte-code cache engine running on each EC2 instance that caches precompiled PHP scripts that boosts performance of PHP applications like WordPress. It is recommended to use a caching engine like OpCache when serving PHP pages for a website from Amazon EFS.  OpCache can be configured to store it's cache in memory or on EBS volumes. 

To learn more about OpCache, please read http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php

#### Offloading Static Assets

WordPress has a large partner ecosystem to further enhance the usability, performance, and ease of maintenance 
We need to advise customers on pros/cons of offloading serving of static assets to S3/Cloudfront with plugins like W3TotalCache. EFS will still be solving the problem of installing plugins that modify the filesystem. Of course for some customers the simplicity of just storing everything on EFS will be preferred.

## Master Template
The master template receives all input parameters and passes them to the appropriate nested template which are executed in order based on conditions and dependencies.

## Master Template
The master template receives all input parameters and passes them to the appropriate nested template which are executed in order based on dependencies.
Review the template here [aws-refarch-wordpress-master.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-master.yaml)

## New VPC Template
Review the template here [aws-refarch-wordpress-01-newvpc.yaml](templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-01-newvpc.yaml)

### VPC and subnet IP ranges

The 'newvpc' stack creates the following network design:

| Item | CIDR Range | Usable IPs | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VPC | 10.0.0.0/16 | 65,536 | The whole range used for the VPC and all subnets |
| Web Subnet | 10.0.0.0/22 | 1022 | Private subnet in first Availability Zone |
| Web Subnet | 10.0.4.0/22 | 1022 | Private subnet in second Availability Zone |
| Web Subnet | 10.0.8.0/22 | 1022 | Private subnet in third Availability Zone (if available) |
| Data Subnet | 10.0.12.0/22 | 1022 | Private subnet in first Availability Zone |
| Data Subnet | 10.0.16.0/22 | 1022 | Private subnet in second Availability Zone |
| Data Subnet | 10.0.20.0/22 | 1022 | Private subnet in third Availability Zone (if available) |
| Public Subnet | 10.0.250.0/23 | 510 | Public subnet in first Availability Zone |
| Public Subnet | 10.0.252.0/23 | 510 | Public subnet in second Availability Zone |
| Public Subnet | 10.0.254.0/23 | 510 | Public subnet in third Availability Zone (if available) |

You can adjust the CIDR ranges used in this section of the [aws-refarch-wordpress-01-newvpc.yaml](/templates/aws-refarch-wordpress-01-newvpc.yaml) template:

```
Mappings:
  SubnetConfig:
    Vpc:
      CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
    WebSubnet0:
      CIDR: 10.0.0.0/22
    WebSubnet1:
      CIDR: 10.0.4.0/22
    WebSubnet2:
      CIDR: 10.0.8.0/22
    DataSubnet0:
      CIDR: 10.0.12.0/22
    DataSubnet1:
      CIDR: 10.0.16.0/22
    DataSubnet2:
      CIDR: 10.0.20.0/22
    PublicSubnet0:
      CIDR: 10.0.250.0/23
    PublicSubnet1:
      CIDR: 10.0.252.0/23
